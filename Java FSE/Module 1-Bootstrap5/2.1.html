  <h2>Bootstrap Folder Structure Explanation</h2>
  <p>The downloaded Bootstrap folder typically contains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>css/</strong>: Contains compiled CSS files like bootstrap.min.css, which provide the styling for Bootstrap components.</li>
    <li><strong>js/</strong>: Contains compiled JavaScript files such as bootstrap.bundle.min.js which include Bootstrap's JS plugins and dependencies like Popper.js.</li>
    <li><strong>icons/</strong>: Contains Bootstrap Icons, a set of SVG icons you can use in your projects.</li>
